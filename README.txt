-----------
   Requires python >= 3.7

   Setup
   -----
   1) Create a virtual environment for the bot (eg. "python -m venv venv")
   2) Install the requirements in requirements.txt
   3) Create a file in discord_bot/ called secrets.hjson containing two keys: "bot_key" and "bot_name" with
      the corresponding values.  Bot name is just used in the identify payload sent to Discord.
